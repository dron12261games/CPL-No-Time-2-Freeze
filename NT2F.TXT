Description             : No Time 2 Freeze - Community project for Doom 2
                          powered by MBF21 compatible source ports with
                          modified Minicharge+ mod by Tango
                          
                          The main feature of the megawad is a snowy/icy
                          setting (not festive, just winter) accompanied by a
                          variety of mostly non-MIDI soundtracks.
                          
                          The 32 maps range from small to gigantic, with a
                          large number of different places to explore. This
                          is also facilitated by an unusual gimmick: on each
                          level, you can find a computer map power-up, which
                          will display the approximate location of all
                          secrets on the automap in the form of snowflake
                          icons, encouraging you to explore. At the same
                          time, the difficulty curve is designed for simple
                          but enjoyable combat that won't distract you too
                          much from the exploration process, but won't leave
                          you without dynamic action either.
                          
                          This project also has co-op support thanks to
                          Odamex 12.1.0 and Doom I + Doom || (KEX Engine).
                          However, Odamex 12.1.0 currently has poor support 
                          for this megawad, and it is likely that you will 
                          need to wait for more stable versions with improved 
                          netcode and fixed UMAPINFO and MUSINFO.
                          
                          Enjoy the game, because you're in for several hours
                          of new and unusual gameplay in Doom.

                          MUSINFO. MAP32 is also unplayable on the port in co-op 
                          due to heavy lag and desynchronization.

------ For mappers ------

About MAP16: Light! Camera! Freeze!

This level was not created just 
to pass and forget it. It's kind of an act 
of passing on my experience to other 
mappers. On this map, I showed how you can 
use special Boom actions and tricks to 
customize incredible lighting in Doom. 
Unfortunately I haven't seen much of this 
in other maps, and I know that many mappers 
don't even know about it. So I urge mappers 
from small to large: Open this map in Doom 
Builder and take it apart piece by piece, 
and then you'll have a powerful new tool in 
your pocket and some clever tricks for 
mapping your maps already.
